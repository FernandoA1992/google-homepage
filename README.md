First Stage.

This project is intended to create a wenpage using HTML that looks like google page (visually).

TO this project what I need is to:

    Two ways to move a div around on the page
    Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
    Identify the background color of an existing webpage
    Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
    Center an element horizontally
    Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
    Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
    Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
